        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Updated March 2023</p>        
        <div class="u-align-left" id="tos">
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>You must be 18 or older to purchase from or commission DrowsySeal.</li>
                <li>Square invoices will be used. Do not send payment until you have received an invoice.</li>
                <li>We have pets! Do not commission if you have allergies to cats, please.</li>
                <li><strong>By placing an order with DrowsySeal, you are confirming that you have read, understood, and accept these terms and conditions.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Age</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You must be 18 years or older to commission or buy a fursuit.</strong> We do not work with minors, even with parental permission.</li>
                <li>ID will be required to confirm age. Please blur out all information besides your name, date of birth, and face. Failure to provide a valid ID will result in cancellation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Payment</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Payment will be made through <strong>Square</strong>. Square takes payments by credit, debit, and bank transfer. An account is not required to use this service.</li>
                <li>Full upfront payment is preferred.</li>
                <li>Payment plans of 50% down with a short time frame are acceptable, but please keep in mind that no project will be started until the full payment is covered.</li>
                <li>If payments are not made within the estimated time frame, the project may be dropped. An extended period of absence without contact will cause the project to be considered abandoned.</li>
                <li><strong>30% of the total payment is non-refundable.</strong> This is to be used for materials and preparation of the project. Should you choose to cancel your commission and request a refund, the amount refunded depends on the amount of work already completed up to the notice of cancellation. <strong>There are no refunds once the project is complete.</strong></li>
                <li>If a commission has been completed and you are unsatisfied in some way, a refund is not required as the service has been completed. However, DrowsySeal is willing to discuss what is wrong and can attempt to work something out.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Shipping</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>DrowsySeal uses the United States Postal Service (USPS) for all shipments, unless otherwise discussed. <strong>Shipping costs must be covered by you upon completion of the project.</strong></li>
                <li>The project will be shipped within 3-5 business days of completion and approval. A tracking number will be provided for United States residents.</li>
                <li>Signature confirmation is required for all mailed commissions with the US.</li>
                <li><strong>DrowsySeal is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged items. </strong></li>
                <li>Between December 10th and January 5th, DrowsySeal will not ship out any large orders. This is due to the increased risk of lost, stolen, and damaged items caused by holiday rush.</li>
                <li>If we are attending the same convention, convention pickup is an option, if discussed ahead of time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Warranty</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>DrowsySeal offers a 60 day warranty. This allows for repairs and fixes on any mistakes made by DrowsySeal. Shipping to us is your responsibility, but we will pay for shipping back to you.</li>
                <li>This warranty does <strong>not</strong> cover damages made by you, such as ripped parts, eye damage, and severe misuse.</li>
                <li>Alterations to the product by anyone other than DrowsySeal, such as cutting, sewing, or adding additional material, will void the warranty.</li>
                <li><strong>We reserve the right to void warranty at our discretion.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Allergies</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>DrowsySeal's workspace is animal-friendly. If you have allergies to cats, please do not commission DrowsySeal, as there is no way to guarantee that allergens will not find their way into the piece.</li>
            </ul>
